PDF-Generator
=============

PDF Generator runs in the background of a machine, monitoring a given folder. Once a file with a distinctive filename pattern is picked up, PDF Generator then launches a new process to convert the given file to PDF and sends a notification email the submitter of the original file using their submitted email address.
